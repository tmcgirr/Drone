# **Autonomous Drone Project**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Open Source Autonomous Drone. This project brings together the best of open-source software and inexpensive hardware components to create an autonomous drone capable of both GPS waypoint missions, manual control, and soon full autonomy in GPS-Denied environments. Powered by Arducopter and built on a DJI frame, this is an ongoing hobby project I have been working on to learn about AI and Drones.

(Updated DJI Phantom 3 Frame)

https://github.com/tmcgirr/Drone/assets/59525360/0599f1e1-abd8-46ec-8554-464f3995b2e9


## **Features**
- **Autonomous Flight:**
    Pre-programmed GPS waypoint missions for hands-free operations.
- **Manual RC Controller Flight:**
    Manual control for precision and exploration.
- **Object Detection:**
    Utilizes the OAK D Lite Stereo/RGB camera for various computer vision tasks.

## **Upcoming Features**
- **Fully Autonomous Flight:** Using 360 Lidar and SLAM (ROS2), the drone will be able to avoid obstacles, map building structures, and continue waypoint missions despite losing radio/telemetry signals.
- **4g Enhanced Range:** Using a 4g Wireless Modem for the Raspberry Pi, the drone will be able to send/receive flight commands and various forms of data anywhere a cell signal can be obtained. (BVLOS when FAA approves this type of operation)
- **Voice Activated Commands:** "Circle me at 30 feet with a 20-foot radius" can be converted from speech-to-text, interpreted by an LLM to analyze the dialog and output commands for drone commands (Possibly [Drone Kit](http://dronekit.io/) circle flight mode around current GPS coords). Think hands-free voice commands with the potential for chained flight commands that can leverage the Object Detection to provide context on the observed environment and perform subsequent actions as needed.
- **Audio Capture:** Fairly standard, however removing the "humming" of motors would be the main challenge. Specific audio pitch range elimination or Neural Net approach from drone training data could be used.
- **Design Upgrades:** Enclosed propellers, smaller or larger frame for increased payload capacity or more portable options, and more aesthetic/functional enclosure.

## **Setup & Installation**
Intro to Autonomous Drones [Quickstart](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.html)
1. **Frame Setup:** The DJI 450 frame works well, but I used a gutted DJI Phantom 3 Frame for this build.
2. **Pixhawk/Motor Setup:** Install the Pixhawk 6c Mini, Power Distribution Board, ESC's, Motors, and wiring using [these instructions](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/assembly/quick_start_pixhawk4_mini.html) or [these](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/frames_multicopter/holybro_x500v2_pixhawk6c.html) as they are similar to the Pixhawk 6c Mini.
3. **RC Setup:** There are several RC configurations, but I used the Spektrum RC with a satellite receiver for this build.
4. **RaspberryPI Configuration:** Set up the RaspberryPI as the companion computer following [this guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/companion_computer/pixhawk_rpi.html) (I use a direct USB connection instead of RPi GPIO connection)
5. **Camera Integration:** Attach the OAK D Lite Stereo/RGB camera. Detailed guide available [here](https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/oak-d-lite-raspberry-pi/).
6. **Software Installation:** Install Arducopter and configure using either Mission Planner or Q Ground Control. Links & resources are provided below.
[Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-installation.html), [Ardupilot Firmware](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/common-loading-firmware-onto-pixhawk.html#), or [PX4 Firmware](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/SetupView/Firmware.html)
